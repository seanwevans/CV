## Experience

### **Data Conversion Laboratory — Remote**
#### *Machine Learning Engineer (May 2021 – Feb 2025)*
- Designed and deployed a Detectron2-based document segmentation model (equations, tables, figures) achieving industry-level accuracy and reducing manual classification by **50%**.
- Built a CNN–RNN equation OCR engine (Torch7/Lua) converting images to LaTeX with near state-of-the-art accuracy in production.
- Automated document styling with NLP + MS Office SDK, reducing a recurring 40-hour manual workflow to **under 2 hours**.
- Implemented a robust OpenCV checkbox detection pipeline (>96% accuracy), tolerant to rotation, noise, and formatting variants.
- Developed high-throughput processing systems capable of millions of pages/week across OCR, normalization, and structural analysis.

### **Data Conversion Laboratory — Remote**
#### *Software Engineer (Sep 2020 – May 2021)*
- Built a scalable PDF cleaning + OCR preprocessing system processing **100k+ pages/week/server**.
- Authored automated LaTeX correction and JATS XML tooling replacing a full-time manual process.
- Developed a comprehensive .docx → XML converter via MS Office InterOp, normalizing heterogeneous client formats.
- Used TDD, Agile processes, and robust XML parsing to deliver production-grade tools.

### **Data Conversion Laboratory — Queens, NY**
#### *Lead Technology Analyst (Sep 2019 – Sep 2020)*
- Led workflow optimization efforts, mentored junior engineers, and coordinated technical communication with stakeholders.

### **Data Conversion Laboratory — Queens, NY**
#### *Technology Analyst (May 2018 – Sep 2019)*
- Built custom data conversion & document-normalization tools for large-scale migration projects.
- Maintained and enhanced high-volume production pipelines across multiple enterprise clients.
