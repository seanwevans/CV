## Experience

### Data Conversion Laboratory - Remote
#### Machine Learning Engineer: May 2021 – Present
- Developed a Detectron2-based ML model to classify document components (equations, tables, figures)
with accuracy on par with industry leaders, reducing manual classification by 50%.
- Automated document styling using NLP (SpaCy) and the MS Office SDK, cutting manual styling time
by half.
- Built an Equation OCR system using a CNN-RNN Encoder-Decoder architecture in Torch7/Lua to convert
images to LATEX, achieving near state-of-the-art accuracy.
- Implemented a checkbox detection system using OpenCV, achieving >96% accuracy across multiple
checkbox formats.

### Data Conversion Laboratory - Remote
#### Software Engineer: Sep 2020 – May 2021
- Implemented a scalable PDF cleaning and OCR pipeline (deskew, despeckle, rotate), processing 100k+
pages/week/server.
- Created automated LATEX correction scripts within JATS XML, reducing a dedicated 40-hour manual
intervention to under 2 hours weekly.
- Built a general .docx converter using MS Office SDK and InterOp, seamlessly handling multiple formats
and tracked changes.
- Employed Agile methodologies, test-driven development, and XML parsing (DOM/SAX) for robust data
transformations.

### Data Conversion Laboratory - Queens, NY
#### Lead Technology Analyst: Sep 2019 – Sep 2020
- Led technical initiatives to streamline processing workflows, mentored junior staff, and coordinated with
stakeholders.

### Data Conversion Laboratory - Queens, NY
#### Technology Analyst: May 2018 – Sep 2019
- Contributed to custom data conversion solutions and maintained production-level tools for large-scale
document migrations.
